# Code for solving the droplet coarsening model using a fully discrete second-order convex splitting finite element method.
This document provides detailed instructions and documentation for the finite element scheme used in simulating the coarsening behavior of a liquid thin film. The scheme is second-order accurate in time and ensures energy stability, crucial for long-term simulations. If you wish to replicate this code, you can refer to the article titled "A second order accurate in time, energy stable finite element scheme for a liquid thin film coarsening model."
